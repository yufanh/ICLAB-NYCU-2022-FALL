ARGUMENTS
       -from from_list
              Reports only paths that start from the specified list  of  pins,
              ports,  nets,  or cell instances; or from startpoints clocked by
              the named clocks. Valid startpoints are clock pins of sequential
              devices and input pins of the design.

       -rise_from rise_from_list
              Same as the -from option, except that the path must start with a
              rising transition. If you specify a  clock  object,  the  option
              selects startpoints clocked by the named clock and launched by a
              rising edge of the  clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_from fall_from_list
              Same  as  the -rise_from option, except that the path must start
              with a falling transition.

       -to to_list
              Reports only paths that end  at  the  specified  list  of  pins,
              ports,  nets,  or cell instances; or at endpoints clocked by the
              named clocks. Valid endpoints are data input pins of  sequential
              devices and output pins of the design.

              Due to the infrastructure of the timing analyzer, the -to option
              runs more efficiently than the -from option. As a  result,  end-
              point-oriented  reporting  flows (based on using the -to option)
              outperform equivalent startpoint-oriented reporting flows (based
              on using the -from option).

       -rise_to rise_to_list
              Same  as the -to option, except that the path data must end with
              a rising transition. If you specify a clock object,  the  option
              selects  endpoints  clocked by the named clock and captured by a
              rising edge of the  clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_to fall_to_list
              Same  as the -rise_to option, except that the path data must end
              with a falling transition.

       -through through_list
              Reports only paths in which the  data  goes  through  the  named
              pins,  ports,  cell  instances, or nets. You can use this option
              multiple times in a command.

              When a single -through list contains multiple objects, the  data
              path  can go through any one of the listed objects. When you use
              multiple -through options, the data path must meet each  of  the
              -through options in sequence.

              For example, the following command reports a path that starts at
              A1, then passes through either B1 or B2, then passes through C1,
              and ends at D1.

                pt_shell> report_timing -from A1 -through {B1 B2} -through C1 -to D1

              If  advanced  analysis  through  transparent  latches is enabled
              (timing_enable_through_paths set to true), and the  pins  speci-
              fied  in  the  last through switch are latch loop breakers, then
              the timing paths reported are constrained by the  worst  of  the
              closing edges at the latch or by a required value computed using
              logic downstream of the latch loop  breaker.   The  latter  con-
              straint is called "time required through endpoint" in the timing
              report, and the latch is said to be constrained  by  "downstream
              required."

       -rise_through rise_through_list
              Same  as  the  -through  option,  except that it applies only to
              paths with a rising transition at the specified objects.

       -fall_through fall_through_list
              Same as the -through option, except  that  it  applies  only  to
              paths with a falling transition at the specified objects.

       -exclude exclude_list
              Excludes  all  paths in which the data goes from, through, or to
              the specified list of pins, ports, nets, or cell  instances;  or
              excludes  all  paths belonging to the specified list of path tag
              sets. It checks only data paths (not clock paths)  for  excluded
              objects.

              Using  the  -exclude  option  can result in significantly longer
              runtimes.   To  reduce  the  runtime  impact,  use  this  option
              together  with  other  topological  restriction  options such as
              -from and -through.

              The -exclude option does not check borrowing paths considered by
              the -trace_latch_borrow option.

       -rise_exclude rise_exclude_list
              Same  as the -exclude option, but applies only to rising transi-
              tions at the named pins, ports, nets, or cell instances.

       -fall_exclude fall_exclude_list
              Same as the -exclude option, but applies only to rising  transi-
              tions at the named objects.

              You  can use no more than one of the -exclude, -rise_exclude, or
              -fall_exclude options in a command.

       -delay_type delay_type
              Specifies the type of path  delay  constraint  to  consider  for
              finding and sorting paths with the worst slack:
              o max (default) -- max delay (setup constraint)
              o min  -- min delay (hold constraint)
              o  min_max   --  both min and max delay (reported min first, max
                second)
              o max_rise  -- max delay, rising at data path endpoint
              o max_fall  -- max delay, falling at data path endpoint
              o min_rise  -- min delay, rising at data path endpoint
              o min_fall  -- min delay, falling at data path endpoint

       -nworst paths_per_endpoint
              Reports up to the specified number of worst paths per  endpoint.
              The  default is 1. A larger value results in a larger report and
              more runtime. Allowed values are 1 to 2000000.

              If you set -nworst to any number greater  than  1,  the  command
              automatically does the following:

              o Implicitly sets -max_paths equal to the -nworst setting if the
                -max_paths option is not used in the command, so that at least
                one set of multiple paths to an endpoint can be reported
              o    Implicitly    sets    -slack_lesser_than    0.0    if   the
                -slack_lesser_than and  -slack_greater_than  options  are  not
                used in the command, so that only violating paths are reported

       -max_paths max_path_count
              Reports up to the specified maximum total number of paths  among
              all path groups. The default is equal to the -nworst setting, or
              1 if the -nworst option is not used. Allowed  values  are  1  to
              2000000.

              If  you set -max_paths to any number greater than 1, the command
              implicitly sets -slack_lesser_than 0.0 if the -slack_lesser_than
              and  -slack_greater_than options are not used in the command, so
              that only violating paths are reported.

              The -nworst option controls the maximum number of paths reported
              per endpoint, whereas the -max_paths option controls the overall
              total maximum number of paths reported.  The -max_paths  setting
              should  be  at  least  as  large  as  the -nworst setting, so by
              default the tool implicitly sets -max_paths to the same value as
              -nworst  if you do not use the -max_paths option in the command.

       -group group_name
              Reports only paths that belong to  the  specified  path  groups.
              Path  groups are created by the create_clock and group_path com-
              mands. Without the  -group  option,  the  report_timing  command
              reports  paths without considering path groups. For example, the
              report_timing command alone reports the single worst path in the
              design,  whereas  report_timing -group [get_path_groups] reports
              the single worst path in each path group.

       -unique_pins
              Reports only the single worst  timing  path  through  any  given
              sequence  of  pins.  No  other  paths  are reported for the same
              sequence of pins from startpoint to endpoint.  For  example,  if
              the  worst  path starts with a rising edge at the first pin of a
              pin sequence, then paths starting with a falling  edge  are  not
              reported for that sequence of pins.

              For non-unate logic such as XOR gates, using this option greatly
              reduces the number of paths reported because of the large number
              of   possible  rising/falling  edge  combinations  through  each
              sequence of pins.

              Using this option can require longer runtimes when used with the
              -nworst  option  because many paths must be analyzed to find the
              worst path through each pin sequence, but only the worst path is
              reported and counted toward the total number of requested paths.

       -slack_greater_than minimum_slack
              Reports only paths with slack greater than the  specified  mini-
              mum_slack  value;  these paths have a negative slack better than
              the specified minimum_slack value (or a positive slack  that  is
              farther from causing a violation). This option is intended to be
              used with the -slack_lesser_than option to report paths within a
              specific range of slack.

       -slack_lesser_than maximum_slack
              Reports  only  paths  with  slack  less than the specified maxi-
              mum_slack value; these paths have a negative  slack  worse  than
              the  specified  maximum_slack value (or a positive slack that is
              closer to causing a violation).

              By default, the report_timing command reports  the  single  path
              with  the worst slack; or if the -nworst or -max_paths option is
              set to a value greater than 1, the command considers  all  paths
              with negative slack, as if -slack_lesser_than is set to 0.0.

              The  -slack_lesser_than  and  -slack_greater_than options act as
              filters to restrict the paths that are reported, so  the  number
              of  paths  reported  can be fewer than the number specified with
              the -nworst and -max_paths options.  If no paths meet the  slack
              criteria, no paths are reported.

       -ignore_register_feedback feedback_slack_cutoff
              Ignores noninverting timing loops that start and end at the same
              register pin that holds a value. To be ignored, the data-to-out-
              put  arc and the output-to-data path must be either both invert-
              ing or both noninverting.  This option applies to minimum  delay
              as  well as maximum delay constraints. Paths are ignored only if
              they have a slack less than the specified  feedback_slack_cutoff
              value.

              This  option  acts  as  a  filter to restrict the paths that are
              reported, so the number of paths reported might be less than the
              number specified with the -nworst and -max_paths options.

       -report_ignored_register_feedback
              Displays a list of ignored paths when you use the -ignore_regis-
              ter_feedback option.

       -include_hierarchical_pins
              Causes the timing path report to show points for the  hierarchi-
              cal  pins  crossed,  as  well  as all leaf pins in the path. The
              hierarchical pins are shown  only  for  documentation  purposes;
              they  are  reported  as having zero incremental delay and do not
              affect the timing results.

       -trace_latch_borrow
              Controls the type of report generated for a path that starts  at
              a  transparent  latch.  If  the path startpoint borrows from the
              previous path segment, using this option causes  the  report  to
              show  the  set  of borrowing paths that lead up to the borrowing
              latch, starting with  a  nonborrowing  path  or  a  noninverting
              sequential loop. Each path segment is reported separately, show-
              ing the time borrowed and lent and the  endpoints  of  the  path
              segment.

              Without  the  -trace_latch_borrow  option,  the command does not
              include upstream borrowing latches when in default latch  analy-
              sis mode or borrowing latch loop breakers when in advanced latch
              analysis mode (timing_enable_through_paths variable set to true)
              as path segments in the timing report.

       -trace_latch_forward
              Controls  the type of report generated for a path that ends at a
              transparent latch D pin. If advanced analysis through  transpar-
              ent  latches  is  enabled (timing_enable_through_paths is set to
              true) and this transparent latch D pin is constrained by a down-
              stream  required time, this option causes the report to show the
              paths in the fanout of this D pin that  led  to  the  downstream
              required  constraint. These paths can include multiple path seg-
              ments whereby  the  constraint  is  the  result  of  propagating
              through  more  than  one  latch  constrained  by  the downstream
              required time. In this case, each path segment is reported sepa-
              rately,  showing the downstream required time for that path seg-
              ment.

              Without the -trace_latch_forward option, the  command  does  not
              trace the path beyond the specified endpoint.

       -pba_mode none | path | exhaustive
              Specifies one of the following path-based timing analysis modes:

              o none (the default) - Disables path-based analysis and  enables
                ordinary graph-based analysis. This is the fastest mode.
              o  path  - Performs path-based analysis on paths after they have
                been gathered by graph-based analysis, producing more accurate
                timing results for those paths. To control the ordering of the
                paths (either by original graph-based  slack  or  recalculated
                path-based  slack),  set  the  pba_path_mode_sort_by_gba_slack
                variable.
              o exhaustive - Performs an  exhaustive  path-based  analysis  to
                determine  the  truly worst-case paths in the design.  This is
                the most accurate and most  computation-intensive  mode.   You
                cannot   use   the   exhaustive   mode   together   with   the
                -start_end_pair, -cover_design, or path_collection options.

              In ordinary graph-based (default) timing analysis, the tool con-
              siders both the worst arrival time and worst slew among all sig-
              nals feeding into a path, even when the worst arrival and  worst
              slew come from different signals.

              In  path-based  timing analysis, the tool considers each path in
              isolation from other paths, which eliminates impossible combina-
              tions  of worst slew and worst arrival, and similar combinations
              of effects such as crosstalk and CRPR. As a  result,  path-based
              analysis reduces pessimism and increases accuracy at the cost of
              more runtime.

       -normalized_slack
              Gathers, sorts, and reports paths using normalized slack instead
              of  absolute  slack.  Normalized  slack  is  the  absolute slack
              divided by an  idealized  maximum  allowable  propagation  delay
              (typically  the  clock  period).  To use this option, the timing
              update  must  be  performed  while   the   timing_enable_normal-
              ized_slack variable is set to true.

       -start_end_pair
              Reports  the worst path for each startpoint-endpoint pair in the
              design, including all  violating  startpoint-endpoint  pairs  by
              default,  or all startpoint-endpoint pairs with slack worse than
              the value specified by the  -slack_lesser_than  option  if  that
              option  is  used.  The  number  of  paths reported is limited to
              2000000.

              The -start_end_pair option overrides  the  default  behavior  of
              reporting only the single worst path in the design. Instead, the
              command reports the worst timing path of each  violating  start-
              point-endpoint pair, which can result in a very large report and
              long runtimes. (Note that the Design Compiler  and  IC  Compiler
              tools differ from this behavior by respecting the default limits
              on the number of paths reported and by  allowing  usage  of  the
              -nworst and -max_paths with -start_end_pair.)

              To  limit the report size and runtime to reasonable amounts, use
              the -slack_lesser_than option and specify a slack limit that  is
              only  slightly  greater than the worst slack in the design.  You
              can also restrict the scope of the analysis by using the  -from,
              -to,  and  similar  options.  You cannot use the -start_end_pair
              option   with    the    -nworst,    -max_paths,    -unique_pins,
              -slack_greater_than, or -ignore_register_feedback options.

              Using the -start_end_pair option requires any -from, -rise_from,
              or -fall_from option to specify only valid  timing  startpoints,
              and  any -to, -rise_to, or -fall_to option to specify only valid
              timing  endpoints;  wildcard  characters  that  specify  invalid
              startpoints  or  endpoints  are not allowed. In other words, the
              timing_report_always_use_valid_start_end_points   variable    is
              treated as set to true, irrespective of its actual setting.

              The -start_end_pair option sorts the paths first by endpoint and
              then by slack, with the paths sharing the same endpoint reported
              together in order of increasing slack.

       -cover_design
              Reports the worst path through each violating pin in the design,
              so that the reported paths cover  every  violating  pin  in  the
              design.  A  pin  is  deemed to be violating if its slack is less
              than  zero,  or  less  than  the  value   specified   with   the
              -slack_lesser_than option if that option is used. The slack of a
              pin is the worst slack among  all  paths  that  start  at,  pass
              through,  or  end  on  that  pin.  The  maximum  number of paths
              reported is 2000000.

              The following options cannot be used with -cover_design:

              -nworst
              -max_paths
              -unique_pins,
              -ignore_register_feedback
              -report_ignored_register_feedback
              -start_end_pair
              -pba_mode exhaustive
              path_collection

       -dont_merge_duplicates
              Prevents the merging of duplicate paths across multiple  scenar-
              ios  when the PrimeTime tool is invoked with the -multi_scenario
              option.

              By default, when the same path is reported in more than one sce-
              nario,  the  tool reports only the single most critical instance
              of that path in the merged report and shows its associated  sce-
              nario.

              If  you  use  this  option,  the  tool  does not merge duplicate
              instances of the same path, but  instead  reports  all  critical
              instances  of the path from all scenarios. Because the number of
              paths reported might limited by -nworst,  -max_paths,  or  other
              command  options,  the  resulting  merged  report  might be more
              focused on a portion of the design that is critical in  multiple
              scenarios,  and less evenly spread out across different portions
              of design.

       -pre_commands pre_command_string
              Specifies a list of commands, separated  by  semicolons,  to  be
              executed  in  the worker (slave) context before execution of the
              report_timing command. This option  is  available  only  if  you
              invoke  the  PrimeTime tool with the -multi_scenario option. The
              maximum size of a command is 1000 characters.

       -post_commands post_command_string
              This option is like the -pre_commands option,  except  that  the
              commands  are executed after (instead of before) the report_tim-
              ing command.

       -path_type format
              Specifies the types of path information displayed in the  timing
              report, using one of the following format keywords:

              o  summary  --  Displays the path startpoint, path endpoint, and
                slack.
              o end -- Displays the path endpoint, path delay, required  time,
                and slack.
              o  short  --  Displays a report like the default full report but
                omits the intermediate points between the startpoint and  end-
                point.
              o  full  (the default) -- Displays the full data path, including
                all intermediate points and their incremental  and  cumulative
                delay,  together  with  the  launch  and capture clock arrival
                times, data required time, and slack.
              o full_clock -- Displays a full report with the addition of  the
                clock path points from the clock source to the launch and cap-
                ture points.
              o full_clock_expanded -- Displays a full_clock report  with  the
                addition  of  the  clock path points between the primary clock
                source and its related  generated  clock  source  point.  This
                report  is  different  from  a full_clock report only when the
                clock is a generated clock.

       -input_pins
              Shows cell input pins as well as cell output pins in the  timing
              path.   As  a  result,  the report shows the incremental net and
              cell delays separately at each point, instead of  combined.   By
              default, the report shows only the cell output pins.

       -nets  Shows  nets  in the timing path. By default, the report does not
              show nets.

       -nosplit
              Prevents line  splitting.  This  can  useful  for  scripts  that
              extract information from the report. By default, the report gen-
              erates a new line when the text cannot fit in the alloted  space
              in a column.

       -transition_time
              Shows  the  transition  time  (slew) in the path report for each
              driver pin and load  pin,  appearing  as  an  additional  column
              labeled "Trans". By default, the report does not show transition
              time.

       -capacitance
              Shows the total capacitance in the path  report  for  each  net,
              appearing as an additional column labeled "Cap". By default, the
              report does not show capacitance.

              The reported value is either the CCS receiver  capacitance  (the
              default)   or   the   lumped   capacitance,   depending  on  the
              report_capacitance_use_ccs_receiver_model variable setting.

       -significant_digits digits
              Specifies the number of digits after the decimal point displayed
              for  time  values  in  the  generated report. Allowed values are
              0-13; the default is determined by  the  report_default_signifi-
              cant_digits  variable, which is 2 by default. Use this option if
              you want to override the default for the  current  report.  This
              option  controls  only  the  number of digits displayed, not the
              precision used internally for analysis.

       -crosstalk_delta
              Reports the annotated delta delay values at cell input pins in a
              column  labeled "Delta". The -input_pins option is automatically
              selected.  The delta values are computed during crosstalk signal
              integrity  analysis,  or they can be annotated manually by using
              the set_annotated_delay -delta_only and set_annotated_transition
              -delta_only commands. Note that the -crosstalk_delta option only
              reports previously calculated or annotated delta values; it does
              not  initiate  crosstalk  analysis.   Delta transition times are
              also shown if you use the -transition_time option.

       -derate
              Shows derating factors in a column labeled "Derate". The default
              is to not show derating factors. Specifying this option automat-
              ically sets the -input_pins option, so that  different  net  and
              cell  derating  values are reported. When you use the -path_type
              full_clock_expanded option, an additional summary report follows
              the  timing  report  showing  the overall effect of derating the
              path. Derating factors are always shown with at least  two  sig-
              nificant digits.

       -variation
              Includes  parametric on-chip variation (POCV) information in the
              report in columns labeled "Mean" and "Sensit". POCV analysis  is
              enabled  by setting the timing_pocvm_enable_analysis variable to
              true.

       -exceptions dominant | overridden | all
              Reports user-specified timing exceptions that are satisfied  per
              timing path being reported.

              Specifying dominant reports the dominant timing exception in the
              path.  It can be one of the following: false path,  minimum  and
              maximum delays, and multicycle paths.

              Specifying  overridden  reports  all  the timing exceptions that
              were overridden by the dominant timing exception.

              The unconstrained paths and their reason  is  reported  for  all
              three  options  if timing_report_unconstrained_paths variable is
              set to true, otherwise unconstrained paths will not be reported.

              To  get  more information about the exceptions that apply to the
              path, you can create a path collection with the get_timing_paths
              command  and  query certain timing path attributes. For details,
              see the man page for the get_timing_paths command.

              Note: The additional analysis required per path with the -excep-
              tions option can be significant, so you can expect a longer run-
              time.  This  option  cannot  be   used   with   the   -path_type
              short/end/summary option.

       -voltage
              Reports  the operating voltage for each path element in a column
              labeled "Voltage", allowing you to debug voltage levels in  mul-
              tivoltage designs.  The displayed voltage is the voltage used in
              delay calculation, which is typically the voltage of the operat-
              ing  condition,  related  supply  net, related power pin, or pin
              signal.

       -supply_net_group
              Reports the supply group or the supply net name  for  each  path
              element  in  a  column labeled "Supply-Net-Group". If the supply
              net group name is not defined, the column shows the word "uncon-
              nected".  If  the supply group is not defined and the supply net
              name is available, then the supply net name is reported  in  the
              column along with the letter "n".

       -sort_by group | slack
              Specifies  the  sorting  of  the reported paths, either by group
              (the default) or by slack. Sorting by group means  ordering  the
              path reports by group, and within each group, by slack. Ordering
              by slack means ordering the  path  reports  strictly  by  slack,
              ignoring group membership.

       -tag_paths_filtered_by_pba tag_name
              When  used  with  the -pba_mode path option, the -tag_paths_fil-
              tered_by_pba option causes tagging of all paths originally found
              by  path-based analysis and later discarded by path-based analy-
              sis, using the specified tag name.  In  future  get_timing_paths
              and  report_timing  commands,  you  can exclude the tagged paths
              from further analysis by specifying the tag name as an  argument
              to the -exclude option.

       path_collection
              Specifies a collection of timing paths to report, for example, a
              collection previously created by set  mypaths  [get_timing_paths
              ...].  When  you use this option with the -pba_mode path option,
              the command performs path-based analysis on  the  paths  in  the
              path_collection  before they are reported.  This option is mutu-
              ally exclusive with options that control the selection of  paths
              to  report  and is compatible only with the options that control
              the formatting of the report.

DESCRIPTION
       The report_timing command reports  the  timing  paths  in  the  current
       design  that have the worst slack. These are the paths that violate the
       timing constraints by the largest amounts, or paths with positive slack
       that come closest to causing a timing violation.

       Each path has a startpoint and an endpoint. Data is launched by a clock
       edge at the path startpoint, propagated through combinational logic  in
       the path, and then captured at the path endpoint by another clock edge.
       The startpoint can be a register clock pin or an input port.  The  end-
       point can be a register data input pin or an output port.

       To  restrict the scope of the report to only the paths that start, pass
       through, or end on specific pins, ports, nets, or cell  instances,  use
       the  -from,  -though,  and -to options, and the similar transition-spe-
       cific options (-rise_from, -fall_to,  and  so  on).   To  restrict  the
       report  to  specific clocks, you can use the same options (for example,
       -to [get_clocks CLK1]) or the -group option.

       By default, the report_timing command without options reports the  sin-
       gle path in the design with the worst max delay (setup constraint) vio-
       lation.  To  consider  constraints  other  than  max  delay,  use   the
       -delay_type  option.  To  control the number of paths reported, use the
       -nworst option, which specifies  the  maximum  number  of  worst  paths
       reported  per  endpoint; and the -max_paths option, which specifies the
       overall maximum number of paths reported by the command.

       To report paths whose slack values fall within a  specific  range,  use
       the  -slack_lesser_than  and -slack_greater_than options in combination
       with the -nworst and -max_paths options.

       The default timing report shows the  point-to-point  sequence  of  cell
       output pins in the data path, as in the following example:

        Startpoint: I_ORCA_TOP/I_PCI_CORE/pad_en_reg
                     (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by PCI_CLK)
        Endpoint: pad[1] (output port clocked by PCI_CLK)
        Path Group: PCI_CLK
        Path Type: max

       The  report  shows the incremental delay contributed by each pin-to-pin
       segment of the path (Incr column) and the cumulative path delay  up  to
       each  pin  in  the  timing path (Path column). The table also shows the
       data launch clock arrival time, the data capture clock arrival time, an
       accounting of arrival time versus required time, and the resulting tim-
       ing slack for the path. A negative slack indicates a timing  violation.

       To  calculate  the  delay contributed by each point along the path, the
       tool considers any back-annotated RC network or SDF delay  information.
       The  types  of  back-annotated data on path elements in the timing path
       are indicated by a character symbol in the Incr column:

         Symbol      Annotation
         ------      ----------
           H         Hybrid annotation
           ^         Ideal network latency annotation
           *         SDF back-annotation
           &         RC network back-annotation
           $         RC pi back-annotation
           +         Lumped RC
           @         HyperScale annotation
         none        Wire-load model or none

       Certain annotations dominate others. For example, SDF takes  precedence
       over  back-annotated  RC  parasitics.  The symbol displayed in the Incr
       column indicates the dominant annotation on the path element.

       If the -input_pins option is used, the report includes the  input  pins
       as  well  as  output  pins of each cell in the path. In that case, each
       pin-to-pin delay spans either a net or cell.  Without  the  -input_pins
       option,  the delay shown can span both a net and a cell. If the net and
       cell have the same  dominant  annotation,  the  appropriate  symbol  is
       shown;  otherwise, the "H" symbol indicates that a hybrid of annotation
       types exists on the corresponding path segment.

       The dominant annotation is not necessarily the actual  annotation  used
       to  calculate the delay.  For example, suppose that a back-annotated RC
       network exists on a net, but the network calculation fails to  converge
       for the driver cell delay.  In that case, you get a warning message and
       a lumped RC model is used instead.  However, in the timing report,  the
       "&"  symbol  still  reports  the  RC network annotation as the dominant
       annotation.  To see the actual pin-to-pin delay calculation in  detail,
       use the report_delay_calculation command.

       To  control  the amount of detail provided in the point-to-point timing
       report, use the following options:

       o -path_type -- Specifies the report format: short,  full,  full_clock,
         ...
       o -input_pins -- Lists the cell input pins (in addition to output pins)
         in the path
       o -nets -- Lists the nets (as well as pins) in the path
       o -transition_time -- Shows transition time (slew) in a separate column
       o -capacitance -- Shows capacitance values in a separate column
       o  -crosstalk_delta -- Shows annotated delta delay values in a separate
         column
       o -derate -- Shows derating factors in a separate column
       o -variation -- Shows POCV mean  and  sensitivity  values  in  separate
         columns
       o -voltage -- Shows operating voltages in a separate column

       To  invoke  path-based  analysis,  use the  -pba_mode option.  In path-
       based timing analysis, the tool considers each path in  isolation  from
       other paths, which eliminates impossible combinations of worst slew and
       worst arrival, and similar combinations of effects  such  as  crosstalk
       and  CRPR.  As  a  result,  path-based  analysis  reduces pessimism and
       increases accuracy at the cost of more runtime.

       The following example shows  a  timing  report  with  the  -derate  and
       -path_type  full_clock_expanded  options.  The -derate option shows the
       applicable derating  factors  in  a  separate  column.  The  -path_type
       full_clock_expanded option reports the clock path points from the clock
       source to the launch and capture points, including points from the pri-
       mary  clock and its related generated clock; and also displays a derat-
